# Minkowski Plane
# Cl(1,1,0) - 2D spacetime algebra
#
# Uses physics (timelike-positive) convention:
#   e1 (space) squares to -1
#   e2 (time) squares to +1
# So v² = t² - x², giving:
#   - Timelike vectors: v² > 0 (inside light cone)
#   - Spacelike vectors: v² < 0 (outside light cone)
#   - Lightlike vectors: v² = 0 (on light cone)

[norm]
# Minkowski plane uses reverse for norm squared computation.
# For vectors, v * reverse(v) = v² gives the spacetime interval.
# With e1² = -1 (space) and e2² = +1 (time), this gives t² - x²,
# which is the physics (timelike-positive) convention:
#   - Timelike vectors: v² > 0 (inside light cone)
#   - Spacelike vectors: v² < 0 (outside light cone)
#   - Lightlike vectors: v² = 0 (on light cone)
