# 2D Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)
# Cl(2,0,1) - 2 positive bases, 1 degenerate basis
#
# Point-based formulation where:
# - Grade 1 = Points (homogeneous coordinates)
# - Grade 2 = Lines
# - Grade 1+3 = Motors (rigid transformations via antisandwich)
# - Grade 0+2 = Flectors (reflections via antisandwich)
#
# Note: In 2D PGA (odd dimension n=3), complement flips parity, so the
# ODD subalgebra [1,3] is closed under antiproduct. This is why Motor
# uses [1,3] instead of the traditional [0,2] - it enables proper
# antisandwich-based transforms.
