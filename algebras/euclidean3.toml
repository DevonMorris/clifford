# Field names reflect what each component DOES (controls rotation around an axis):
# - rz (e12): rotation around the z-axis (in the xy-plane)
# - ry (e13): rotation around the y-axis (in the xz-plane)
# - rx (e23): rotation around the x-axis (in the yz-plane)

[types.Rotor]
grades = [0, 2]
description = "3D rotor (unit versor for rotations)"
# Rotors represent 3D rotations via the sandwich product: R * v * R^-1
# - s: scalar part (cos(theta/2) for a rotation by angle theta)
# - rz, ry, rx: rotation components (see Bivector docs)

# Note: Entity_0_3 (scalar + pseudoscalar) is valid but rarely used
# Note: Entity_1_3 (vector + trivector) is the odd subalgebra
