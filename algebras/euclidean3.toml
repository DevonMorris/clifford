# IMPORTANT: The bivector components represent rotation AXES, not directions.
# - bz (e12): rotation around the z-axis (in the xy-plane)
# - by (e13): rotation around the y-axis (in the xz-plane)
# - bx (e23): rotation around the x-axis (in the yz-plane)
# The field ordering (bz, by, bx) follows lexicographic blade order (e12, e13, e23),
# which happens to be reverse alphabetical for the axis names.

[types.Rotor]
grades = [0, 2]
description = "3D rotor (unit versor for rotations)"
# Rotors represent 3D rotations via the sandwich product: R * v * R^-1
# - s: scalar part (cos(theta/2) for a rotation by angle theta)
# - bz, by, bx: bivector parts representing the rotation plane/axis (see Bivector docs)

[types.Trivector]
grades = [3]
description = "3D trivector (pseudoscalar)"
fields = ["ps"]

# Note: Entity_0_3 (scalar + pseudoscalar) is valid but rarely used
# Note: Entity_1_3 (vector + trivector) is the odd subalgebra
