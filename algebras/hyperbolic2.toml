# Norm Configuration
# ============================================================
# Non-degenerate algebra (r=0) with indefinite signature (p=2, q=1).
# Uses reverse for the norm: |x|² = x * x̃
# The norm can be positive (spacelike), negative (timelike), or zero (null).
# Implements IndefiniteNormed trait.
