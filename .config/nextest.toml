# Nextest configuration for clifford
#
# This configuration handles Symbolica's global state requirements by running
# Symbolica tests serially while keeping all other tests parallel.
#
# Usage:
#   cargo nextest run                    # Run all tests
#   cargo nextest run -p clifford-codegen  # Run codegen tests only
#
# See: https://nexte.st/docs/configuration/

# Define test groups for controlling concurrency
[test-groups]
# Symbolica tests must run serially due to global state conflicts
symbolica = { max-threads = 1 }

[profile.default]
# Use all available CPU cores for non-Symbolica tests
test-threads = "num-cpus"

# Symbolica tests are identified by the `symbolica_` prefix in their name
[[profile.default.overrides]]
filter = "test(symbolica_)"
test-group = "symbolica"

[profile.ci]
# CI profile with same settings
test-threads = "num-cpus"
# Fail fast in CI
fail-fast = true
